# Code of Conduct

We value the participation of every member of the scientific community. Accordingly, everyone is expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone taking part in this project and its associated discussions is required to conform to the following **Code of Conduct**.

## The Short Version

* We are dedicated to providing a **harassment-free experience** for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of individuals in any form.
* **All communication should be appropriate** for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.
* **Be kind** to others. Do not insult or put down others.
* **Behave professionally**. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.
* Anyone violating these rules will be excluded from this project and their inappropriate comments removed.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly project for all.

## The Longer Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Anyone asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you.

If someone engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the team members take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the project.
