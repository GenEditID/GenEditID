The files have mostly been stripped to leave a 96 well plate with 3 clones and 2 normalisations.
The wells are in their original locations on the plate but will be reorganised once their results can be tested.

Since the merge and join stages don't work on the unmerged google drive data, only premerged and joined fastq data is supplied.
